# alphabets_recognition_app
This project is a full-stack application for recognizing handwritten lowercase alphabet characters (aâ€“z). Predicts both single and multiple characters accurately

It consists of:

Flask Backend: A Python-based API that uses a pre-trained Keras model to predict characters from image.

Flutter Frontend: A mobile app where users can draw characters, get predictions.

Training Script: A Python script to train the Keras model using a custom dataset, with data balancing and augmentation.

The system allows users to draw a letter, predict it using a neural network.
